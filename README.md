# Raw Awesomium Bindings #

Raw bindings to [Awesomium](http://www.awesomium.com)(1.6.5) for
Haskell. For more user friendly, higher-level bindings look
[here](https://github.com/MaxOw/awesomium).

You will need Awesomium library installed on your system, ideally in
`/usr/lib/awesomium-1.6.5/`. Otherwise you will have to change the
`extra-lib-dirs:` in `.cabal` file.
